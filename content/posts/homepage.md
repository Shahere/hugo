Hi,

Iâ€™m Savinien !

I am an apprentice engineer in the IT field at [ENSSAT](https://www.enssat.fr), in Lannion where I am expected to graduate in 2025.

I am always looking for new things to learn and give. Development, cyber security, system or network administration are topics on which my internship can focus, and I'm interested in.

Currently focus on real-time communication developpement at [Apizee](https://www.apizee.com) through a work-study program.
