# Openreplay contributor

![Openreplay LOGO](/img/openreplay.png)

[Openreplay](https://openreplay.com) is a log and sessions replay solution. 

The self-hosted solution **could not be installed locally**, with the docker-compose method.

I change the docker-compose method to **allow local installation** of openreplay.
